# Wamplify

![Wamplify Logo](https://wamplify.me/opengraph-image.png);
Wamplify is a WAM Calculator for the University of Melbourne. It helps students set achievable academic goals and see how they might affect their overall marks. Wamplify is [available here](https://wamplify.me/).

## How it Works

Wamplify scrapes subject information from the University of Melbourne handbook, including when subjects are offered, their assessments, and how those assessments are weighted. Users can enter their current WAM to see how their results may affect it. Wamplify is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Jotai](https://jotai.org/).

## Running it Locally

To run Wamplify locally, run:

```bash
npm i
# then
npm run dev
```

> [!NOTE]
> Wamplify uses Node v18.13.0.
