          Wamplify is a UniMelb WAM calculator for students at the University of Melbourne. Enter your marks for the
          assessments you have completed. Then, choose the overall mark youâ€™re aiming for and Wamplify will show you
          what you need in your remaining assessments to reach that target, and how it will affect your WAM.
