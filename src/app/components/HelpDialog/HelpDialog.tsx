          Wamplify is a tool for students at the University of Melbourne to
          estimate their marks and set academic goals.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Enter your marks for the assessments you have completed. Then, choose
          the overall mark youâ€™re aiming for and Wamplify will show you what you
          need in your remaining assessments to reach that target, and how it
          will affect your WAM. All scores are estimates!
        </p>
        <p>Good luck on your assessments!</p>
